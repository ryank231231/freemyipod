emCOREFS is a FUSE-based filesystem that uses emCORE's Monitor API
to provide communication with device's FS. It is still in very early
state, but some features (directory listing, reading files) are done.

For communication with the device, this application uses libusb 1.0.

Building
--------
You need:
1. GCC/Make
2. pkg-config
3. libusb >= 1.0
4. libfuse >= 2.8
5. maybe other packages

Compiling:
make - standard build, no debug messages, only fatal errors on
    startup are shown.
make debug - debug build, some debug/error messages are shown.
    libusb debug messages are enabled, too.

Testing:
make test - run the build without FUSE debugging messages, going
    into the background if it connects to the device successfully.
make testdebug - run the build in the foreground, showing FUSE debug
    messages in the terminal.

Running
-------
You need FUSE >= 2.8 installed.
Currently only tested on Linux (Ubuntu 11.04 in my case). Maybe an
OSX-compatible version would appear at some point.
Starting: ./emcorefs <mountpoint>
Stopping: fusermount -u <mountpoint as seen in /etc/mtab>

Known bugs/issues
-----------------
* Read-only support at the moment.
* Running FUSE with multithreading breaks file reading because of
    the way these are implemented on emCORE's side.
    Workaround: use the "-s" option.
* Most errors are not handled properly, EIO (Input/output error) is
    given in many cases where there's a more descriptive error
    message available. Will be fixed in the future.

Future plans
------------
* Implement write support.
* Merge some functions that are doing similar tasks to reduce code
    duplication. Return proper error codes in FS operations.
