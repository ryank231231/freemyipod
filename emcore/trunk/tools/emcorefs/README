emCOREFS is a FUSE-based filesystem that uses emCORE's Monitor API
to provide communication with device's FS. It is not yet complete,
but most features are done. It runs on both Linux and Mac OS X.

For communication with the device, this application uses libusb 1.0.

Building
--------
You need:
1. GCC/Make (Xcode on OS X)
2. pkg-config
3. libusb >= 1.0
4. libfuse >= 2.8 (or fuse4x on x64 OS X)
5. all dependencies of the above

Compiling:
make - standard build, no debug messages, only fatal errors on
    startup are shown.

make debug - debug build, some debug/error messages are shown.
    libusb debug messages are enabled, too.

You can prefix any of these with
CFLAGS="-DDEBUG_USB_PACKETS"
in order to have a dump of the usb traffic that's being sent and received.

Testing:
make test - run the build without FUSE debugging messages, going
    into the background if it connects to the device successfully.

make testdebug - run the build in the foreground, showing FUSE debug
    messages in the terminal.

Running
-------
You need FUSE >= 2.8 installed. (or fuse4x on x64 OS X)
Currently tested on:
- Linux (Ubuntu 11.04 x86)
- Mac OS X (10.6.8 x64)

Starting: ./emcorefs <mountpoint>
Stopping: fusermount -u <mountpoint as seen in /etc/mtab> (Linux)
          diskutil unmount <mountpoint as seen in /etc/mtab> (OS X)
Known bugs/issues
-----------------
* Write support not tested very well.
* Running FUSE with multithreading breaks file reading because of
    the way these are implemented on emCORE's side.
    Workaround: use the "-s" option.
* Most errors are not handled properly, EIO (Input/output error) is
    given in many cases where there's a more descriptive error
    message available. Will be fixed in the future.

Future plans
------------
* Merge some functions that are doing similar tasks to reduce code
    duplication. Return proper error codes in FS operations.
