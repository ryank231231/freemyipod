COMPILING:

You need an appropriate libbfd.a and libiberty.a for your target to 
build this tool. They are normally part of the binutils package.

To compile elf2emcoreapp do:

    ./configure --target=<ARCH> --with-libbfd=<libbfd.a> --with-libiberty=<libiberty.a>
    make
    make install

The <ARCH> argument to configure specifies what the target architecture is.
This should be the same target as you used to build the binutils and gcc
cross development tools. The --with-libbfd and --with-libiberty arguments
specify where the libbfd.a and libiberty.a library files are to use.


FILES:

README          - this file
configure       - autoconf configuration shell script
configure.in    - original autoconf file
config.*        - autoconf support scripts
Makefile.in     - Makefile template used by configure
elf2emcoreapp.c - the source

TIPS:

If you are using the Rockbox toolchain, you'll need to kill rockboxdev.sh
after it compiled libbfd and before it removes the binutils build directory.
Use the following configure command:
./configure --target=arm-elf-eabi \
            --with-binutils-build-dir=/tmp/rbdev-build/build-binutils \
	    --with-libiberty=/usr/lib/libiberty.a

This worked fine for me. --TheSeven
